# Hotel_review_rating
Problem Statement:
The hospitality industry heavily relies on customer feedback to maintain and improve service quality. With the advent of online platforms, customers frequently share their experiences through reviews, often accompanied by a rating. These reviews are valuable as they provide insights into customer satisfaction, but manually analyzing thousands of reviews can be time-consuming and inefficient.

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can automatically classify hotel reviews as positive or negative based on the text of the reviews. Given a dataset of customer reviews and their corresponding ratings, the model should learn to understand the sentiment expressed in the text and accurately predict whether a review is positive or negative.

Objectives:

1.Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the review text to remove noise, such as irrelevant information, stopwords, and special characters.

2.Feature Extraction: Convert the textual data into numerical features using techniques such as TF-IDF, word embeddings, or other relevant methods.

3.Model Training: Train a machine learning model to classify reviews as positive or negative based on the extracted features.

4.Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5.Application: Deploy the model to automatically label new reviews as positive or negative, providing a quick summary of customer sentiment.
