# Hotel_review_rating
Problem Statement:
The hospitality industry heavily relies on customer feedback to maintain and improve service quality. With the advent of online platforms, customers frequently share their experiences through reviews, often accompanied by a rating. These reviews are valuable as they provide insights into customer satisfaction, but manually analyzing thousands of reviews can be time-consuming and inefficient.

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can automatically classify hotel reviews as positive or negative based on the text of the reviews. Given a dataset of customer reviews and their corresponding ratings, the model should learn to understand the sentiment expressed in the text and accurately predict whether a review is positive or negative.
